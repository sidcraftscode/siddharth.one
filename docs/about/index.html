<p>Hey there! My name is Siddharth Chaudhary, or Sid for short.</p>
<p>My passion has always been to create, and I found a way to do that using code.</p>
<h3 id="what-am-i-currently-working-on">What am I currently working on</h3>
<h4 id="easy-ui">Easy UI</h4>
<p>I&#39;m working on my Forem Community, Easy UI. Easy UI is a community all about building websites and the stuff involved, mostly from a frontend perspective. If you don&#39;t know what <a href="https://forem.com">Forem</a> is, it&#39;s an open source community software built by the same people that run <a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a>. Easy UI is still a small community, but I hope to grow it soon.</p>
